chatGPT = advanced AI chatbot; remembers context
based on GPT3 model. GPT4 avail for plus users ($20/mo)
- GPT - generative pretrained transformer 
- developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate natural language texts

### Use Cases for Devs
- general learning tool
    - shows steps
    - examples (not always correct)
    - resources

- provides code feedback
- specific solns
- brainstorming
- generate sample data (mockeroo is another service provider for data)
- generating documentation
- explaining /debugging errors
- writing tests
- natural language programming; understand fundamentals
- creating UI's

## Masterclass
presented by Uditha Bandara, Bluechip, Inc. Recording will be avail on [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-emerging-technology-meetup/events/292657415/)  

- chatGPT is a model trained by openAI, an non-profit research laboratory. Microsoft is an investor. It has a for-profit subsidiary.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT

- Use cases: explaining, summarizing, testing, generating content from prompts

### Some of the guardrails for chatGPT: 
- Check ouptuts - factcheck. It's a language model so it uses probability to generate language. It's not mandated to produce evidenced based facts. Be aware of its propensity for "hallucination."
- Avoid inputting proprietary or confidential information. All of the inputs will be used for training. (This is part of the AI lifecycle.)
- AI tools need to build and compile. Does not use most current information. Updates every 2-3 months. (Not directly useful for stock market projections, but provides solid foundation for knowledgebase.)
Youtube has tutorials as well.

- openAI - MS is investor. Eventually MS bias. Incorporated in products. Currently independent.

    - NLP is branch of AI, currently only text based. Eventually audio.

- interactive responses compared to google
- can be used as Linux terminal
- can write music
- can translate. Provides explanation
- solves maths questions with explanations
- text summarization
- can be used for explaining. Option: "Explain like I am 5"

### Cautions
- Note: inputs will be used for training (part of AI lifecycle). Watch using confidential info
- Usage during peak times can produce internal errors (US work hours)
- info is outdated in terms of current events. AI tools need to build and compile. Updates every 2-3 months. Faster updates available from paid version
- Jac: Always be skeptical of responses and fact check if necessary, it "hallucinates" by making things up because it's language model only. I've heard It is not mandated to produce evidenced based facts, it uses probability to generate language only.  Translate and data analysis can be wrong, so always double-check so you don't get fired!

### prompt engineering
new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use lang mdls for wide variety of applications and research topics

### Implementing 
- generate images using AI. Other tools better than chatGPT

- Breakdown of how translate or summarize: 
    - Python NLTK Natural Language Toolkit provides tools and resources for building  https://www.nltk.org/ and anaconda
- Integrations thru chatGPT API

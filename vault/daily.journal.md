### Notes from 100devs teaspill with Madeleine B on Coffee Chats

Hey Guys, I took some notes on the tea spill today. There is quite a bit because I wanted to capture all of it. I thought it would be helpful to me.

1. Once you can care less about what others may be thinking of you, the sooner you will be happier and free. You can then be free to do what you want without fear of judgement
2. If a coffee chat fails (unlikely) then thats okay. You both just move on. The other person likely doesnt care that much. If a coffee chat gets real bad you can just hang up. So dont fear because you can always exit
3. If you do get a coffee chat, they accept it cause they care. They want to be there and talk to you. They wont accept just to show up and be a jerk. They want to make a friend ðŸ™‚
4. Madeleine noted that she has gotten her jobs from Coffee Chats and Twitch streaming
5. LinkedIn is a great avenue for Coffee Chats. Find a random app you use. Search for a developer that works there and ask for a coffee chat
6. Dont go in with a script. Be genuine and be there just to make a friend. You can have backup questions in case of awkward emergency
7. You can pregame a coffee chat by looking at their socials and seeing what they are interested in
8. Be the one who does all the planning, take mental effort off of the other person. (Scheduling, Starting the conversation, Ending the conversation when you feel its over or when the time is up). Make it easy for the other person (Dont be scared to finish the chat early)
9. Very important, directly after the coffee chat send a thank you note. Provide them with that little bit of value. Let them know you appreciate their time. If you end up getting the job or they have impacted you. Let them know. They will love it. Be genuine and nice.
10. If you have social anxiety or want to practice chatting. There is a social anxiety meetup in this discord
11. Come up with your own questions that you'd like to ask.
12. Make it fun and genuinely love people and be interested in them. Both will enjoy it more.
13. Take notes of the coffee chats if you can. Anything that you learned about them. That way if you run into them again you can pull it up and show them that you remember and are interested in them. Speaks a lot
14. When cold asking for a coffee chat, it is good to get to the point and buttering up isnt really needed
15. Lastly, be yourself. People dont really care (In a good way) so just be yourself and do your thing.

[Practical Vim](https://digtvbg.com/files/LINUX/Practical%20Vim%20-%20Drew%20Neil_1241.pdf) looks amazing

[Read the docs like a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDJ5vXRPZCE)

- recticular activating system lets important information through and blocks out unimportant noise
- activated when reading documentation - cover to cover (not skimming)
- helps prime brain
  - brain creates landmarks /map, connections
- chatgpt has answeers, but not questions
- reading dox gives relative advantage b/c very few do

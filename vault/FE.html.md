# HTML Document Structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> - signifies html5 version
<html lang="en"> - beginning of document
	<head> - top o' doc including metadata; not displayed on page;  links to external files, etc. 
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Something to Say</title> - doc title is displayed on title bar in browser
	</head>
	<body> - visible content within web page
		<h1>Say it Loud & Proud</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
?Why are elements nested?

The W3C has built both HTML and CSS validators that will scan code for mistakes. 

???html <pre />  - preserves whitespace, old - non-responsive, not recommended 

html:
?root element
?children of html element 
head and body are where everything happens

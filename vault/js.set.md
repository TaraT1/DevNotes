# Js.Set() (Javascript Set)
- Set() can only be constructed with new. Attempting to call it without new throws a TypeError.

## Map vs Set
Map in JavaScript behaves similarly to a hashmap, offering O(1) average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations under optimal conditions. The choice between using a Map or a Set should be based on the specific requirements of your application, such as the need for unique values (Set) or the necessity to associate values with keys (Map).

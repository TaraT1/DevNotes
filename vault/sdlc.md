- deployed to production environment

## Phase 6 Maintain
- live and used by customers
- enhancements, bug fixes, new features
- product mgr determines which initiatives make it to product roadmap

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- lowers cost of software dev
- improves quality
- shortens dev timelines by preventing after the fact fixes
- stakeholder input in early stages of development
- everyone gets costs and resources needed to complete

### Cons

A library for books is like data with the need for effectively storing data and showing relationships like genre, author, fiction/non-fiction, etc. Data is organized/structured efficiently using various techniques (departments, catalogs, shelves, etc.)

## Data Structure
- organized way of storing data for use by computer processes
- pattern of collecting and organizing data for performing various operations correctly and efficiently.

### vars and scope
- let (with scope and mutability) and const; 
- naming provides meaning and context the data

### arrays 
container object used to hold a list of items usually of the same type (like list of pages numbered in ascending order for easy nav)

### objects 
- store collection of related data or functionality in key-value pairs
- Compared to arrays they hold more complex entities of varying types

**The best data structures consume minimal resources while storing data in a meaningful way for various operations.**
- Consider if relationship is preserved and data is easily accessible

## Algorithms
well defined computational procedures that take input and produce output

Properties:
- input - 0 or more externally provided
- output - 1 or more 
- correctness - every step
- finiteness 

Considerations:
- time complexity (execution time of an operation)
- space complexity (memory usage of an operation)

## SWE's responsibility
Modern apps are data-driven: accept, store, process, and output data. SWE's responsibility to create models of problem domain so data is organized and manipulated in consistent manner with respect to problem at hand

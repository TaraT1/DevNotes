String interpolation is used to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders `string text ${expression}`

Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.

Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation

# WebSocket
WebSocket is a computer [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol), providing a simultaneous two-way communication channel over a single [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP) connection.  

A WebSocket is a technology that enables a persistent, bi-directional communication channel between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. 
- Unlike traditional HTTP requests that operate on a request-response model, WebSockets allow for continuous, real-time data exchange in both directions without the need for constant [[BE.polling]]. This makes WebSockets particularly useful for applications requiring live updates, such as chat applications, real-time analytics, and interactive games. Once established, a WebSocket connection remains open, allowing data to flow freely between the client and server until the connection is explicitly closed by either side.

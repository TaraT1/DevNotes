# Nonrelational Database
- mongoDB, Perst, Cassandra, neo4J

- A nonrelational database stores data in non-tabular form
- tends to be more flexible than relational db structures
- does not follow relational db mgt systems
- noSQL
- Used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized

# Arrays
- data structure to store ordered collections
- array elements are numbered starting with 0 (zero indexing)
- have methods to manage order of elements
- can be created by a constructor or literal  notation

## Declaring arrays
```
newArr = ['Zebra',true,21]
```

- empty spaces leave empty element

## Array Iteration
forEach - array iterator
```
let bestColors = ['green','blue','yellow','black']

bestColors.forEach((x,i) => console.log(x))
```

- iterates through array passing in value and index of each element
